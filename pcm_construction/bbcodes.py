    Creates a parity check matrix for a bivariate bicycle code.

    The function implements the construction of a parity check matrix for a bivariate bicycle code, 
    as described in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07915.pdf).

    Parameters:
    - l (int): The first dimension parameter of the bicycle code.
    - m (int): The second dimension parameter of the bicycle code.
    - A_poly (list): List of tuples representing powers of x in the A matrix polynomial.
                     Each tuple should be of the form (0 or 1, power).
                     0 corresponds to x, 1 corresponds to y.
    - B_poly (list): List of tuples representing powers of x in the B matrix polynomial.
                     Each tuple should be of the form (0 or 1, power).
                     0 corresponds to x, 1 corresponds to y.

    Returns:
    - H (numpy.ndarray): The resulting parity check matrix.
    - Hx (numpy.ndarray): The left part of the parity check matrix. Which we consider for X-error detection.
    - Hz (numpy.ndarray): The right part of the parity check matrix. Which we consider for Z-error detection.

    Note: We make Hx to detect X-errors and Hz to detect Z-errors omitting the symplectic product. That is, 
    when a quantum error e operates on a CSS QEC code, it does so through the symplectic product. 
    
            (
                0      Hx                           
    H o e =     Hz       0      o (ex | ez)^T     =  (Hx * ex | Hz * ez ) ^T
                            )
    
    In order to ease computations, we will consider the right hand side of the equation directly when
    considering noise decoding. And so we will construct a parity check matrix not in the symplectic form
    to which we can apply the error product directly.
