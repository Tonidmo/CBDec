## Description
This branch focuses in optimizing the classes and methods associated to these that conform the Closed Branch Decoder, implementing those in C++ and making them available to pythone source code of the decoder as an interface.

## Building
At this initial moment, the build script as a Makefile only supports linux platforms with g++ compiler. It generates a `build/` folder which holds the object files and the generated shared library in `build/lib/CBlib.so` and a library test binary in `build/tests/CBlib_tests`. To build the whole project, the following process can be followed:
```bash
git clone -b CBlib https://github.com/Tonidmo/CBDec.git
cd CBDec
git submodule update --init
make

# To only build the library
# make lib
# and to only build the tests
# make tests
```
