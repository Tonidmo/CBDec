# CBDec
 
 The closed branch decoder is a new type of generic decoder for quantum error correcting codes. In this repository we provide our code as a tool for interested readers so they can make simulations on other quantum error correcting codes provided that they have a parity check matrix. This is the first version of the code, which has been done entirely in Python, thus, the speed needs to be improved to a great amount. Neverthless, it provides an interesting sand box for researchers interested on the decoder.
